bash
Copy code
cd backend
npm install
npm start
Install frontend dependencies and run the Angular app:
bash
Copy code
cd ../frontend
npm install
ng serve
Your application should now be accessible at http://localhost:4200.

Usage
This section can include any specific usage instructions or guidelines for the application. For example, how to perform CRUD operations, navigate through the frontend interface, and interact with the API endpoints.

Backend (Express.js)
The backend of the application is built using Express.js, a popular Node.js framework for building robust and scalable web applications. It provides API endpoints to interact with the frontend and manage data in the database. Key features:

RESTful API endpoints
Middleware for authentication, error handling, etc.
Modular route organization
Database (MariaDB)
The application uses MariaDB, a powerful open-source relational database, to store and manage data. MariaDB provides data persistence and retrieval for the backend of the application. Key aspects:

Schema design and data modeling
CRUD operations using SQL queries
Connection pooling and optimization
Frontend (Angular)
The frontend is built using Angular, a modern and powerful framework for building dynamic single-page applications. It provides an interactive user interface to interact with the backend services. Features:

Component-based architecture
Data binding and real-time updates
Routing and navigation
