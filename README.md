## Description

This project demonstrates the implementation of a web application with a decoupled architecture, utilizing Express.js for the backend API, MariaDB as the database, and Angular for the frontend user interface. The application showcases the basic interactions between these components, providing a foundation for further development and customization.

## Installation

Follow these steps to set up and run the application locally:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/sampath-bandara/math-tinder.git
   cd math-tinder

2. Install backend dependencies and start the Express server:

    ```bash
    cd backend
    npm install
    npm start

3. Install frontend dependencies and run the Angular app:

    ```bash
    cd ../frontend
    npm install
    ng serve

Your application should now be accessible at http://localhost:4200.


## Usage

This section can include any specific usage instructions or guidelines for the application. For example, how to perform CRUD operations, navigate through the frontend interface, and interact with the API endpoints.

## Backend (Express.js)

The backend of the application is built using Express.js, a popular Node.js framework for building robust and scalable web applications. It provides API endpoints to interact with the frontend and manage data in the database. Key features:

* RESTful API endpoints
* Middleware for authentication, error handling, etc.
* Modular route organization

## Database (MariaDB)

The application uses MariaDB, a powerful open-source relational database, to store and manage data. MariaDB provides data persistence and retrieval for the backend of the application. Key aspects:

* Schema design and data modeling
* CRUD operations using SQL queries
* Connection pooling and optimization

## Frontend (Angular)

The frontend is built using Angular, a modern and powerful framework for building dynamic single-page applications. It provides an interactive user interface to interact with the backend services. Features:

* Component-based architecture
* Data binding
* Routing and navigation
